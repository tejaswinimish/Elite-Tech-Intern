Password Strength Evaluation Tool ðŸ› 
As part of my ongoing learning journey in tech, I built a tool to assess password strength based on key criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Password security is a crucial aspect of our digital lives, and this tool helps users gauge how strong their passwords are. It's a simple, yet essential step in fostering better security practices! ðŸ’¡
